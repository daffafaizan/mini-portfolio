          My thesis was about{" "}

          and it&apos;s implementation on data exchange marketplaces.

          In my free time, I game, read, and build/study. I&apos;m a casual
          gamer who enjoys FPS and strategy games. You can find me on CS2,
          VALORANT, Age of Empires III, Stellaris, and Master of Orion. I mainly
          read sci-fi stories and tech articles: you can check out some of my
          favorites{" "}

          </Link>
          (and infer the tech I&apos;m currently learning too!). I grouped
          building and studying together because most of what I learn revolves
          around programming, and Iâ€™ve always believed in learning by doing.
          That&apos;s why I&apos;m always working on side projects.
